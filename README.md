Welcome. 

I'm a data scientist and consultant. My expertise covers collecting and using data to make better decisions. 


My preferred analytical languages are Python and R. I use SQL and PySpark for data manipulation, and use modern serialisation formats such as Feather. 
Infographics and communication documents are written in Latex or Markdown and use high quality digital image formats

My background is in mathematics and academic research: https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MYlPrE0AAAAJ&hl=en
