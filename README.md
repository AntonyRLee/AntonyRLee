Welcome. 

I'm a data scientist and consultant. My expertise covers collecting and using data to make better decisions. 

Skills:
+ My preferred analytical languages are Python and R
+ I use SQL and PySpark for data manipulation, and modern serialisation formats, such as Apache Feather
+ Infographics and communication documents are written in Latex or Markdown and use high quality digital image formats

My background is in mathematics and academic research: https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MYlPrE0AAAAJ&hl=en
